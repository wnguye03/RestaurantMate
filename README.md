# My Personal Project - Restaurant Mate (Restaurant take-out management software)
## By: William Nguyen

## What will the application do?
The application will provide customers a menu to order take-out from and when they order and pick a time a new order will show up in the restaurant's internal food service application approx 10-15 minutes before the pick-up time. The order will also be specified that it is a take-out order and will also list the relevant details of the orders, such as, the item to be prepped, the time to pick-up, and the name of the customer. Once done the restaurant staff can check off that the item has been prepared.

On the customer side the customer will receive a summary of what they ordered and the sum total of the order. Moreover, on the customer side their will be a visual to display the current status of their order. Ultimately, once the food is done and bagged the application will send the customer a notification to pick up the food.

## Who will use it?
The primary user base for this application will be the restaurant industry and the people they serve. More specifically the people who will use it are:
- Managers and Shift leaders
- Kitchen staff
- Front of house staff
- Customers (viewing the status of their order)

## Why is this project of interest to you?

The reasoning for this project stems from my experience working in the restaurant industry, where I worked at the popular and fast-paced **_Cactus Club_** restaurant group. Although our software for managing orders in-house was good I felt that our internal take-out software needed improvements to improve the coordination between the kitchen and expo staff. I experienced this first hand as an **Expo**, where it was my job to coordinate all orders coming into the restaurant and I found that our software made it difficult to identify and prioritize sit down orders versus takeout orders. Therefore, my goal is to improve the experiences of guests and the make my former colleagues jobs easier.
